All the files are precompiled in the names, masterserver, vc and sk, however you may recompile them from the source codes, with -lpthread appended, please see the image for reference.

Step 1:

Run the Masterserver with <input.dat and >log.dat, to take input from the input.dat file, and output them to the log.dat file.

Step 2:
Open n new terminals where n is the no. of processes, and execute the client process from each, the processes should be showing how many more processes they are expecting to connect before they all start executing.

Step3: After each process outputs the message "All tasks completed...", you may close the masterserver program, along with rest of the terminals.

Step4: While executing the process do output to the terminal whenever any event occurs, also the log file gives a detailed overview.

Input File Format:

Input file must contain n, l, a, m where n is no. of processes, l is inter event delay in secs(integer), a is the ratio of internal and message sending events(double), and m is total no. of events(int). Followed by the topology in the form of adjacency matrix.

Note: Adjacency Matrix has been used as input instead of Adjacency List, as in the samle input format there was no identifier mentioned to indicate where the list of one process ends, and another starts, ie, if Adjacency list is 

1 2 3
4 5 
1 3 7 8 9 0 

there is no marker between 1 2 3 and 4 5, thus when reading we cant know where the list of one stops and another begins.

Also a sample input.dat file is provided for an example of 5 processes , dealy of 1 and ratio of 1 and also a topology is given, along with a log file on running SK algorithm.
Also note log files of successive runs may differ as messages are always send to seudo random processes among neighbors.
