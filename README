All the files are precompiled in the names, masterserver, cl and ly, however you may recompile them from the source codes, with -lpthread appended.

Step 1:

Run the Masterserver with <input.dat and >log.dat, to take input from the input.dat file, and output them to the log.dat file.

Step 2:
Open n new terminals where n is the no. of processes, and execute the client process from each, the processes should be showing how many more processes they are expecting to connect before they all start executing.

Step3: After each process outputs the message "All tasks completed...", you may close the masterserver program.

Step4: While executing the process do output to the terminal whenever any event occurs, also the log file gives a detailed overview.

Input File Format:

Input file must contain n, A, T, l where n is no. of processes, A is initial Balance of every process, T is the amount of Transaction in system after which system should terminate, and l is the Lambda ie, the random wait time. 
Followed by the topology in the form of adjacency matrix or Spanning tree in case of Lai Yang.

Note: Adjacency Matrix has been used as input instead of Adjacency List, as in the samle input format there was no identifier mentioned to indicate where the list of one process ends, and another starts, ie, if Adjacency list is 

1 2 3
4 5 
1 3 7 8 9 0 

there is no marker between 1 2 3 and 4 5, thus when reading we cant know where the list of one stops and another begins.

Also a sample input.dat file is provided for an example of 5 processes.
Also note log files of successive runs may differ as messages are always send to pseudo random processes among neighbors.
