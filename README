All the files are precompiled in the names, masterserver, ray and sk, however you may recompile them from the source codes, with -lpthread appended.

Step 1:

Run the Masterserver with "<input.dat" and ">log.dat", to take input from the input.dat file, and output them to the log.dat file.

Step 2:
Open n new terminals where n is the no. of processes, and execute the client process from each, the processes should be showing how many more processes they are expecting to connect before they all start executing.

Step3: Monitor the masterserver terminal, once the system has terminated, the masterserver would terminate automatically and you may read the log.dat.

Step4: While executing the processese do output to the terminal whenever any event occurs, also the log file gives a detailed overview.

Input File Format:

Input file must contain n, k, i, a, b where n is no. of processes, k is the no. of times they work and execute cs, i is the process that initially has the token(i<n), a is max time spend doing work outisde CS, b is max time spend doing work inside CS.

Also a sample input.dat file is provided for an example of 5 processes.

Also note log files of successive runs may differ as messages are always send to pseudo random processes among neighbors.
